Meteorites having become more common over time - improvements in recording?

```{r}

# removed meteorites period to 1950 as generally aren't really recorded. In addition, anything post 2019 (current year) is also removed.
meteorites_processed %>% 
  filter(year >1950 & year < 2019) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(y="", x='Decade of meteorite fall', title="Recording of meteorite falls only really began post 1970")

```

Mass of meteorites are log normally distributed. 

```{r}

meteorites_processed %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log(mass))) + geom_histogram() +
  labs(y='',
       x='Meteorite Mass (Log Scale)',
       title ='Mass of meteorites is log normally distributed')
```

Meteorites have gradually getting large since the 1970s although not as large prior to this point in time. NB - the sample size of falls per decade is significantly smaller for 1950s and 1960s giving much more uncertainty around the estimates.

```{r}
meteorites_processed %>% 
  filter(year >1950 & year < 2019) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=decade, y=log10(mass), group=decade)) + geom_boxplot(notch=T) +
  labs(x="Decade",y="Mass of Meteorites (Log2 Scale)",
       title="Meteorites having been getting heavier over time since the 1970s") 

# how do I get all over the breakpoints into this?
```

Plot which shows changing volumes of meteorite impacts and their associated weight since 1950s. Primary changes appears to be actually recording strikes in Africa in circa 1990 onwards.

```{r}
anim <- meteorites_processed %>% 
  filter(year >1950 & year < 2019) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(long, lat)) +    
  geom_point(aes(color=log(mass)),alpha=1/8) +
